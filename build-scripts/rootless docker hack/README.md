The `string-replace` script modifies the Docker command that rust-embedded/cross executes because the command can't be run as is when Rootless Docker is installed instead of Docker. The `docker` script acts as a proxy. Note: ` -e USER=contrasleuthonbaremetal` in the `string-replace` script needs to be changed depending on your username. The path to Rootless Docker in the `docker` proxy script also need to be changed.
